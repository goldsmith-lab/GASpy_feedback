We have chosen to not perform testing at this time for various reasons.
- The methods in which we plan to select new calculations is an active area of
  our research, and so things are always evolving. Testing slows down the speed
  at which we can perform this research.
- Each new function we add is unlikely to build on an older function, so
  changes are less likely to affect old code.
- A lot of the heavy-lifting (code-wise) is done by GASpy, which relatively
  tested.
